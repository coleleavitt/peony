# Benchmarking peony

How to measure peony honestly against mold, lld, and GNU ld, and how to read the
numbers. The methodology here follows the consensus of a model-council review and
a deep-research pass on how mold/lld/wild benchmark themselves (see
`../docs/incremental-linking-theory-research.md`).

## TL;DR

```sh
# 1. freeze a real link's object set into a replayable corpus
bench/capture.sh rust-bin   rust-hello /path/to/cargo/project --release
bench/capture.sh c          hello-c    /tmp/hello.c
bench/capture.sh cxx        hello-cxx  /tmp/hello.cpp

# 2. correctness-gate + time peony vs mold vs lld vs bfd
bench/bench.sh --runs 20 --warmup 5
```

Results land in `bench/results/<corpus>.{json,md}`.

## The cardinal rules

1. **Correctness before speed, always.** `bench.sh` first links the corpus with
   every linker, runs the output binary, and compares stdout+exit to an lld
   reference. A linker whose output differs is **excluded from timing** — a fast
   wrong linker is worthless. Never quote a speed number for a link you did not
   first prove correct.

2. **Measure the link step, not the build.** `capture.sh` freezes the exact
   `cc`-level argv of a real final link (the `.o`/`.rlib`/`.a` set + flags) so
   replaying it never recompiles. Benchmarking `cargo build` instead measures
   rustc, not the linker.

3. **Hold flags byte-identical across linkers.** The corpus is linked through the
   same compiler driver (`cc`/`c++`) with only the linker swapped via
   `cc -B<dir>` (each `<dir>` exposes the chosen linker as `ld`). The LTO
   `-plugin` flags are stripped at capture time so every linker sees the same
   plain-ELF object set.

4. **Warm the cache, report the median.** `hyperfine --warmup 5 --runs 20`
   reports median ± σ. Cold-cache numbers measure the page cache, not the
   linker.

5. **Output to tmpfs.** Link outputs go to `/dev/shm` so the SSD is not in the
   measurement. (The correctness gate copies the binary to an exec-capable dir
   first, because `/dev/shm` is often `noexec`.)

## Reducing variance

- Pin the CPU governor to performance: `sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance`.
  `bench.sh` warns if the governor is not `performance`.
- Pin cores: `bench/bench.sh --pin 0-7` wraps each link in `taskset -c 0-7`.
- Normalize thread count: `bench/bench.sh --threads 8` passes `--threads`/
  `-Wl,--threads=` to each linker that supports it.
- Close other workloads; run on AC power.

## What the numbers mean (current honest baseline)

Measured on a 24-core machine, warm cache, plugin-stripped, identical flags.
peony is built `--release`. These are **honest** numbers — peony links every
corpus itself (no fallback to bfd).

Two epochs are shown: **before** the parallel/zero-copy rewrite and the
**current** numbers after each shipped phase. peony is built `--release`.

peony/mold ratios below are hyperfine median, 15 runs, warm cache, identical
flags (a non-`performance` governor adds noise to absolute ms — the *ratio* is
the honest figure).

| corpus       | inputs | peony/mold (start) | peony/mold (now) |
|--------------|-------:|-------------------:|-----------------:|
| hello-c      | 1      | ~2.6×              | **1.13×** (near parity) |
| hello-cxx    | 1      | ~2.4×              | **1.36×**        |
| rust-hello   | 23     | ~2.0×              | **1.45×**        |
| ripgrep      | 419    | ~3.3×              | **2.17×**        |

The headline: **ripgrep closed from 3.3× to 2.17×** behind mold, and the small
links are now within ~1.1–1.4×. All four still pass the correctness gate (peony
output runs and matches the lld reference).

**What moved the needle (measured, not guessed)** — a per-phase scaling profiler
(`--stats`/`--trace`, see `baselines/phase0-baseline/FINDINGS.md`) drove three
shipped wins, NONE of which was the symbol resolver the plan first assumed (only
3.2% of the link):

1. **build-id hash** (`748867d`): was 30% of a ripgrep link, fully serial,
   hashing all ~18.5MB of scattered input. Now hashes the ~4MB contiguous
   *output* in parallel blocks — 17× faster (53ms→3ms), whole link −30%.
2. **zero-copy section data** (`1413aae`): sections borrow from a link-wide mmap
   arena instead of a per-section `Vec<u8>` copy; emit blits straight from the
   mmap. Another −30% on the link. (RSS unchanged — the resident bulk is
   anonymous per-object metadata, not section bytes; see FINDINGS.)
3. **parallel parse** (`3bd7efd`): race-free via object-local owned rebase;
   parse-bare 11→7ms.

**Remaining gap, by measured self-time (ripgrep, best-of-8, ~60ms total):**

1. **parse+resolve ~24ms** — parse-bare 7.6ms (parallel, near floor), archive
   fixpoint 5.9ms (serial), resolve-bare 2.6ms.
2. **reloc-postproc ~8.7ms** — GOT/PLT/TLS slot extraction + dynsym assignment
   (serial, 1.04×).
3. **resolve-inputs ~8ms** — `-l` library path resolution + script expansion (I/O).
4. **layout ~7.4ms** — serial address assignment.
5. **emit ~8.8ms** — scales 2.2×, no single hotspot; done.

**Peak RSS:** peony ~155MB (`--threads 1`) / ~216MB (`--threads 0`) vs mold ~8MB
on ripgrep. The bulk is **anonymous per-object metadata** (symbol table + 419
objects' section/symbol/reloc `Vec`s), not section bytes — so closing it needs a
metadata-compaction effort (interned/arena-allocated symbols, compact section
records), a separate larger project, not the section-byte zero-copy already done.

## Where peony already wins: the edit–rebuild loop

mold and lld have **no incremental mode**: every rebuild is O(total). peony
caches the last link and, on a rebuild, checks each input with a single `stat()`
(size + mtime + inode).

**No-change relink (verified):** `peony --incremental` on rust-hello (23 inputs)
is **15 ms vs mold's full link 28 ms — 1.9× faster**, and the output is
byte-identical to a full peony link. The reuse path is O(#inputs) syscalls (no
content read, no thread pool), and a changed input correctly falls back to a
full link (test `incremental_cache_invalidates_on_input_change` — the cache
never serves stale bytes).

```sh
peony --incremental <args> -o out   # first call links + caches
peony --incremental <args> -o out   # unchanged inputs → ~instant reuse
```

**Edit-one-object relink (in progress):** currently this falls back to a full
link (~36 ms, ~3.8× behind mold's 9.5 ms). The capacity-stable in-place patch
that wins this case is proven in `rocq-tests/IncrementalCostBound.v`
(`incremental_beats_fromscratch`: a single-file edit touches 1 section, not n)
and is the next increment — the from-scratch wall-clock gap is a constant
factor, but the incremental gap is asymptotic and is the design's real edge.

## Continuous benchmarking (CI)

`bench/criterion/` holds criterion micro-benchmarks of the internal hot paths
(symbol resolution, GC BFS, relocation apply). They run under
`cargo bench -p peony-bench` locally and under `cargo codspeed` in CI
(`.github/workflows/bench.yml`) so regressions are caught per-PR. End-to-end
wall-clock (this harness) is the source of truth; the criterion benches localize
*where* a regression came from.
